The sw4lite correctness tests assume that sw4lite was built with OpenMP threading and with the
C-kernel. The latter allows the index ordering to be switched in the developer command. 

For example, from the main sw4lite directory, you can build the sw4lite executable with

>make ckernel=yes omp=yes raja=yes

The sw4lite executable will then reside in the directory optimize_mp_c_raja_cori.

To run the sw4lite correctness tests on Cori (KNL partition) you should first start an interactive session:

>salloc -N 1 -C knl,quad,cache -p debug -t 00:10:00 -L SCRATCH

The test script resides in the pytest sub-directiory and is called test_sw4lite.py. The command line
options are explained by doing

>./test_sw4lite.py -h
 
It is necessary to tell the python test script where to find the sw4lite executable. For example:

>./test_sw4lite.py -d optimize_mp_c_raja_cori

Currently, only two tests are performed. If both tests pass, you should get the following output on your screen:

Running all tests for level 0 ...
Test # 1 Input file: pointsource.in PASSED
Test # 2 Input file: curvilinear.in PASSED
Out of 2 tests, 0 failed and  2 passed

You can adjust the number of OpenMP threads and MPI-tasks by using the -m and -t options.
